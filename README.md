# Final-Project-CSPS
Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling (SPIDAM) Project

Our project is a Python application with the purpose of identifying the frequency ranges that have the longest reverb times (RT60), in order to implement the proper acoustic treatment. Created to improve voice intelligibility.

Basic Usage: 
1)Upload audio file(.wav or .mp3).
2)Select the graph you want to display.
